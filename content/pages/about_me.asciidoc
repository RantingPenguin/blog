Who am I?
=========

I'm open source enthusiast since about the beginning of this millennium. I
participate actively since around 2004 and nowadays I'm a full-time open source
developer living my dream.

As you can guess from the beginning, I'm the optimist by nature. But even
optimists need to let of some steam once in a while. That is why I created this
blog/identity, to rant about everything that sucks.

I'll try to stay away from politics and focus on technical stuff. It will help
me stay optimistic if I get to swear once in a while on blog and I hope that
somebody will enjoy it as complaining about people doing stuff is much more
popular than actually doing something.
