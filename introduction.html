<div class="paragraph"><p>So I tried to create a blog to rant about stuff. And first thing to rant about
is how to actually create blog. The current hype is to use static page
generators. There is like a ton of them. Most of them support Markdown, which
sucks because I prefer <a href="http://asciidoc.org/">Asciidoc</a>. It was here first,
some claim that it is more feature complete, doesn&#8217;t have tons of dialects and
syntax is more straight forward (ok the last one is subjective).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There is still quite some that claim to support Asciidoc. Most of them claim to
support just Asciidoctor although I have no idea why they choose just one
specific implementation. But more importantly, most of it doesn&#8217;t work well
anyway. So in the end I ended up using <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>
which finally works (after trying several generators that claimed to have
Asciidoc and that didn&#8217;t worked). Pelican supports Asciidoc only through
plugin, but hey, it works and it was using this or write something on my own.
Writing it myself wouldn&#8217;t be that hard, but there is too much stuff already
and it is much better and harder to reuse then to start from scratch again
(more about it in another post).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Common errors I encountered in other generators included claiming Asciidoc
support and not actually having it. Maybe the worse option was actually having
some partial support where I ended up with HTML document included in another
HTML. Including full head and full css generated by Asciidoc. So that quite
sucked, but luckily I encountered Pelican and it seems to work correctly.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So my first post actually has some happy ending. Well, I promise the next time
I will swear more and complain more about how stuff sucks to actually fulfill
the mission of this blog.</p></div>
